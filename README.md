# The Linked Web APIs dataset generator

## Desription
This repository is used for maintenance of the code for the generation of the Linked Web APIs dataset from ProgrammableWeb.

## Note
Please note that we are currently working on integration of additional data sources thus the code from this repository has been reused in the https://bitbucket.org/m1ci/semantic-web-apis-hub repository.
The https://bitbucket.org/m1ci/semantic-web-apis-hub maintains the code for several scripts for retrieval of information from several data sources (e.g. ProgrammableWeb.com, Apis.io, etc.).
